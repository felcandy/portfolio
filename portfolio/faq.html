			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>What programs or materials do you use?</dt>
				<dd>For digital art, I use CLIP STUDIO with a Wacom Intuos Pro (medium). My sketchbooks are usually Moleskine brand, but sometimes I like to use very inexpensive sketchbooks to experiment in. I love the Pitt Artist Pens for inking, and a Pentel Graph Gear 500 Mechanical Pencil, 0.5mm for drafting. My watercolor brand of choice is M. Graham honey watercolors.</dd>
				
				<dt>What level of education do you have?</dt>
				<dd>I have a bachelor’s degree from Arizona State University for Health Science, and I am an undergraduate student enrolled at Wilmington University for a BS in Computer Science. I did not go to school for art, but I took many watercolor and oil painting electives during my studies.</dd>
				
				<dt>What is your commission availability and/or pricing scale?</dt>
				<dd>My commissions are currently closed as I work on my degree. Normally, I will charge for materials used, technique and medium applied, subject matter, and my time.</dd>
				
				<dt>Can I use your artwork for (tattoos, merchandise, wiki pages, etc)?</dt>
				<dd>I would appreciate if you send me a message in my <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> form or to my <a href="mailto:dvanallen001@my.wilmu.edu">email</a> address for permission to use my artwork. I generally do not want my artwork physically distributed or sold. I do not mind if you ask permission to host my artwork on wiki pages or other websites, as long as you credit fully.</dd>
				
				<dt>What advice do you have for a beginner artist?</dt>
				<dd>Just. Keep. Drawing. Honestly, the more you draw or use your creative muscles, the stronger you will be as an artist. I am still practicing every day and I do studies and sketches a’plenty. The key to anything is practice.</dd>
